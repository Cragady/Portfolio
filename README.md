# Purpose

This was a revamp of the original portfolio assignments, or new portfolio entirely to house the projects worked on throughout the class. This portfolio, to me, is now a good stepping point to where I want my actual portfolio to look like. The current react based portfolio is under works, but for now this one is being used.

You can check out my current portfolio, hopefully by the time you click the link, my react portfolio will be finished or close to being finished.

New portfolio: [code](https://github.com/Cragady/RePortfolio) [app](https://evening-beach-49814.herokuapp.com/portfolio)
