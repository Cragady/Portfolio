                    <p class="p-2 mt-4 p-indent">My name is Craig, I'm currently seeking a more technicaly oriented career. 
                        To actualize this goal, I attended a six month long coding bootcamp hosted by the University of Utah. 
                        My experience with this course was crucial for my growth as a developer. It has given me a strong 
                        starting point to build off of, and has given me important studying techniques to learn new technologies 
                        and current web development practices. With these techniques, I can keep expanding my knowledge to learn 
                        anything I set my mind to.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-2 p-indent">My interest in web development began as I was taking a class through SLCC,
                        Living in a Digital World. On one assignment, the class was split into groups to build a wiki page.
                        This excersize required the groups to create a mock event; the wiki had a complete setup with scheduling,
                        a map of the area with hotel markers, video advertisements, and descriptions of the event.
                    </p>

                    <p class='p-2 p-indent'>
                        One of my responsibilities was the overall design of the page. The wiki had templates available for this
                        portion. The vanilla templates were boring, so I explored my options with the setup. There was an option
                        to edit the html of the page. It was with this that I was exposed to HTML and inline CSS. Since then 
                        I've had a fascination for what makes a web page what it is, and how it works; I've decided to take steps 
                        towards becoming a web developer. 
                    </p>

                    <p class='p-2 p-indent'>
                        While learning web development, I had those same feelings of satisfaction as I did with the group project 
                        in my early college days. With the SLCC class, everything was purely visual. When I was introduced to 
                        JavaScript, I learned I could do anything that any other website could do with the correct implementation
                        of logic. This added a whole new level of nuance to web development that I found enthralling. Being able to
                        approach a problem with code, and finding a solution feels very rewarding. Even rewarding at the times where 
                        a work around, or a new approach is necessary for the completion of the overall goal.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4 class='m-3 text-center'>A more personal and relaxed note:</h4>

                    <p class='p-2 p-indent'>
                        I have several different hobbies, most the time I can't keep up with them all as I like to experience a plethora
                        of activities. To work around my need for a vast set of hobbies, I focus on a few and touch up on the lesser visited 
                        hobbies sporadically. 

                    </p>

                    <p class='p-2 p-indent'>
                        I usually like to go longboarding when the weather is nice, or if that seems a bit too quick paced for me at the 
                        time I'll just go on a walk. I also enjoy gaming, although recently I haven't had as much time to devote towards gaming
                        as I have in the past, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; I am devoting more time towards learning and self-driven
                        projects.
